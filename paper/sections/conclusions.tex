\section{Conclusions}\label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a tool that automates the traceability link recovery by identifying trace links between requirements written in natural language and software development artifacts(Issues, PRs, Commits) obtained from GitHub repositories. Through the implementation of three optional methods, namely keyword extraction, TF-IDF vector and word vector, we have demonstrated the capability of identifying traceability links of our tool. We have stored the traceability data we obtained in a graph database to visualize the trace links, and supported the data with an interactive dashboard, which provides users with comprehensive statistical insights.

In conclusion, our tool provides an automated solution for requirement traceability(RT) and enhances the management of software projects. By optimizing the time and effort required for RT and offering educational opportunities for project management, our tool contributes to the overall success of software development projects. With future development and evaluation, our study carries the potential to positively impact traceability practices.
