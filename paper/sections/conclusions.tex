\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

This paper aims to visualize software repositories through the trace links from requirements to other software development artifacts that are issues, pull requests, and commits. We extract trace links using three different methods: \emph{i.} keyword matching, \emph{ii.} TF-IDF vectors, and \emph{iii.} word vectors and store the repository information and traces in a graph database. We query the database to visualize the information from the repository such as the number of traces of a requirement per week, traces of a requirement, created and closed issues, and other statistics in a dashboard to have a better understanding of the development process. We present the results of a preliminary evaluation of the performance of trace link extraction methods and our future evaluation plans. We envision our dashboard to be used for educational purposes as well as in the industry.

Our immediate future work includes a thorough evaluation of the performance of the trace link extraction methods and the usefulness and usability of our dashboard. The approach itself can be extended by incorporating other artifacts to be analyzed from the repositories. The performance of the techniques can be enhanced by using bigger and software-related corpora for the word-vector method. Our own keyword-matching technique can be compared against large language models for the same task.
